24 cameras so far
Students have 48 hours to borrow a camera before returning it
*Equipment is pretty expensive, so it's important for it to be tracked to maintain the products.*
Checkout sheets are as follows:
- 

| Name | Camera # | Date Out | Date In | Extras |

BookIt? MIT? 
- Online database where students can checkout cameras virtually
- Students would input what they needed it for, date in, date out.

**Ideas:**
- Students should be able to check out cameras without having to go into Dr. Dunleavy's office.
	- If he is busy with another student he often has to tell students to come back later if they want to check out a camera.
- Website where students can request an available camera
	- Should send an email to Dr. Dunleavy so that he has time to prepare the camera
- Send students an email 24 hours before their camera is due
- Section to manage inventory
	- Table of all inventory
	- Ability to add and remove inventory
