### Problem
Performance reviews are not streamlined
- In general, paper wasn't working because some would want to write more and some would want to write less.
-  Supervisor, cabinet member, and employee.

**Process**
Supervisor starts with clean form.
Fills out information including employee and boss (senior rater).
Filled out

**Requests**
Email notifications when next step is ready.

*When in draft process, the form should be hidden from the employee*
