# ==Bronchiectasis==

==_braang·kee·_====_**ek**_====_·tuh·suhs_==

> [!important]  
> Bronchiectasis is a chronic condition where the walls of the bronchi (major air passages to the lungs) are thickened from inflammation and infection. People with bronchiectasis have periodic flare-ups of breathing difficulties, called exacerbations.  

Around 500,000 americans have it.

## Symptoms

- Coughing up yellow or green mucus daily
- Shortness of breath that gets worse during flare-ups
- Fatigue, feeling run-down or tired
- Fevers and/or chills
- Wheezing or whistling sound while you breathe
- Coughing up blood or mucus mixed with blood, a condition called hemoptysis
- Chest pain from increased effort to breathe
- Clubbing, or the thickening of the skin under nails

  

## Diagnosis

Bronchiectasis is diagnosed by checking for any abnormalities in the functioning of the lungs. If malfunction is suspected, then an X-Ray or CT Scan is performed, which will give a detailed image of the lungs, revealing any inflammation.

  

## Treatments

The most common treatments for bronchiectasis include:

- **Antibiotics**
- **Mucus Thinning Medication**
    - prescribed to help bronchiectasis’ patients cough up mucus
- **Airway Clearance Devices**
    - patients exhale into a hand-held device to help break up mucus.

  

## Managing Bronchiectasis

- **==Quit smoking==** and avoid secondhand smoke.
- Maintain a healthy diet, low in sodium, added sugars, saturated fats and refined grains.
- Stay hydrated, drinking plenty of water to help prevent mucus build-up.
- Be diligent about taking oral and inhaled medications and performing mucus clearance techniques daily.
- Staying up to date on vaccinations.
- Take antibiotics for one to two weeks during flare-ups.
