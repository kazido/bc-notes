Homogeneous ==systems are systems written as==

$Ax = 0$

where $A $﻿ is an $m$﻿x$n$﻿ matrix and $0$﻿ is the zero vector in $\mathbb{R}^m$﻿.

> [!important]  
> Homogeneous systems always have at least one solution (the zero vector in @import url('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.16.9/katex.min.css')Rn\mathbb{R}^nRn﻿)  

The zero solution is called the ==trivial solution==

Any nonzero solutions are ========================================nontrivial solutions========================================

The homogeneous equation $Ax= 0$﻿ has a nontrivial solution if, and only if, ($\iff$﻿) the equation has at least one free variable.

### Solution Sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$﻿

For $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$﻿, with a 3x3 matrix and $\vec{b}$﻿ in $\mathbb{R}^3$﻿

|# of Pivots in $A$|# of Free Variables|Solution Set|
|---|---|---|
|3|0|${(0, 0, 0)}$|
|2|1|line through origin|
|1|2|plane through origin|

For $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$﻿, with a 3x3 matrix and $\vec{b}$﻿ in $\mathbb{R}^3$﻿, suppose $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$﻿ is consistent and has the particular solution $\vec{p} (A\vec{p}=\vec{b})$﻿

|# of Pivots in $A$|# of Free Variables|Solution Set|
|---|---|---|
|3|0|1 point $\{\vec{p}\}$|
|2|1|line through $\vec{p}$|
|1|2|plane through $\vec{p}$|
