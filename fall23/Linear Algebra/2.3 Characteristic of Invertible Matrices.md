==**==========Theorem: (Invertible Matrix Theorem)==========**==

Let $A$﻿ be an $n\times n$﻿ matrix. Then the following are logically equivalent:

1. $A $﻿ is invertible
2. $A$﻿ reduces to the identity matrix, $I$﻿
3. $A$﻿ has $n$﻿ pivots
4. $A\vec{x}=\vec{0}$﻿ has only the trivial solution $\vec{x}=\vec{0}$﻿
5. The columns of $A$﻿ are linearly indepenedent
6. The transformation $T:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$﻿ with $T(\vec{x})=A\vec{x}$﻿ is one-to-one
7. $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$﻿ has a solution for every $\vec{b}$﻿ in $\mathbb{R}^n$﻿
8. The columns of $A$﻿ span $\mathbb{R}^n$﻿
9. $T(\vec{x})=Ax$﻿ is onto
10. There is an $n\times n$﻿ $C$﻿ with $CA=I_n$﻿
11. There is an $n\times n$﻿ $D$﻿ with $AD = I_n$﻿
12. $A^T$﻿ is invertible

  

==_Corollary:_== Let $A$﻿ and $B$﻿ be square ($n\times n$﻿) matrices and suppose $AB=I_n$﻿

Then $A$﻿ & $B$﻿ are both invertible, and $A^{-1}=B$﻿, and $B^{-1}=A$﻿

An ==inverse transformation== is when $S(T(\vec{x}))=\vec{x}$﻿ and $T(S(\vec{x}))=\vec{x}$﻿. In this case, $S$﻿ is the inverse transformation of $T$﻿.
