## Cryptography

_the study of methods for sending secret messages_

It involves **encryption**, in which a message, called ==**plaintext**==, is converted into a form, called ==**cipher text**==, that is sent over a channel possibly open to view by outside parties.

The receiver uses ==**decryption**== to convert the cipher text back into plaintext.

  

RSA encryption

  

### Modular Equivalence

The following are equivalent:

$(5*8)=40\equiv1\mod3$﻿

  

$(5\mod3)(8\mod3)=2*2\equiv1\mod3$﻿

  

EULER CIRCUIT:

each vertex has an even degree

## Alphabets

A language is a set of characters.

_Since it is a set, this means no duplicates._

==**Notation**==

Let $\sum$﻿ be an alphabet. For each nonnegative integer $n$﻿, let

$\sum^n$﻿ = the set of all strings over $\sum$﻿ that have length $n$﻿

$\sum^+$﻿= the set of all strings over $\sum$﻿ that have length at least 1

$\sum^*$﻿ = the set of all strings over $\sum$﻿
