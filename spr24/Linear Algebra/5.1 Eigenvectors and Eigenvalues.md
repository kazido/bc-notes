Definition: If $A \vec{x} = \lambda\vec{x}$﻿ has a solution $\vec{x}\neq\vec{0}$﻿, where $A$﻿ is $n\times n$﻿, then $\lambda$﻿ is an eigenvalue of $A$﻿ and the vector $\vec{x}$﻿ is an eigenvector of $A$﻿.

  

Example 1:

$A = \begin{bmatrix}2&0\\0&2\end{bmatrix}$

So 2 is an _eigenvalue_ of $A$﻿, and every non-zero vector $\vec{v}$﻿ in $\mathbb{R^2}$﻿ is an _eigenvector_ of $A$﻿ with eigenvalue 2.
