Rotation matrix:

$\begin{bmatrix}$

A mapping $T: \mathbb{R}^n$﻿ ⇒ $\mathbb{R}^m$﻿ is said to be ====================one-to-one==================== if each $b$﻿ in $\mathbb{R}^m$﻿ is the image of at most one $x $﻿ in $\mathbb{R}^n$﻿

- Free variable $\implies$﻿==~~one-to-one~~==

A mapping $T:\mathbb{R}^n$﻿ ⇒ $\mathbb{R}^m$﻿ is said to be ==========onto========== if each $b$﻿ in $\mathbb{R}^m$﻿ is the image of at least one $x$﻿ in $\mathbb{R}^n$﻿

- Row of all zeros $\implies$﻿~~==onto==~~
