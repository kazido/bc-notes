A rectangular matrix is in ==echelon form== (or ====================row echelon form====================) if it has these properties

1. All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros
2. Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it
3. All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros

  

If the matrix follows these properties AND

1. The leading entry in each row is a 1
2. Each leading 1 is the only entry in its column

then it is in ==================================================reduced row echelon form================================================== (R.R.E.F.)

> [!important]  
> Any 1’s or columns with 1’s in it are pivot positions/columns respectively→ Pivots are used to create zeros in other rows with row operations  

### Row Reduction Algorithm

**Echelon Form** ==============================(forward phase)==============================

1. Leftmost nonzero column
2. Select a nonzero entry from the column (move it to the top if necessary)
3. Create zeros below the entry
4. Cover the row with the pivot position and repeat steps 1-3

**Reduced Row Echelon Form** ==(backward phase)==

1. Begin with the rightmost pivot and create zeros above the point
    1. If the pivot is not a 1, make it a 1 via scaling

Do this until the matrix is in R.R.E.F.

The ==blue 1’s== are the pivot points.
