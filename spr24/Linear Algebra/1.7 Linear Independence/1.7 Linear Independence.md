A set of vectors $\{v_1, v_2, v_3, ..., v_p\}$﻿ in $\mathbb{R}^n$﻿ is ==linearly independent== if and only if the only solution to $x_1\vec{v_1}+x_2\vec{v_2}+...+x_p\vec{v_p} = \vec{0}$﻿ is $\vec{x} = \vec{0}$﻿.

Example:

In $\mathbb{R}^2$﻿, let $\vec{v_1} = \begin{bmatrix}$﻿ and $\vec{v_2} = \begin{bmatrix}$﻿

then $\{\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2}\}$﻿ is linearly independent because

$x_1\begin{bmatrix}$﻿

has only the solution $x_1=x_2=0$﻿

The columns of matrix $A $﻿ are linearly independent if and only if the equation $Ax = 0$﻿ has only the trivial solution.

> Recall: the trivial solution is the $0$﻿ solution

A set of two vectors $\{v_1, v_2\}$﻿ is ==linearly dependent== if at least one of the vectors ==is a multiple of the other==. The set is ==linearly independent== if and only if ==neither of the vectors is a multiple of each other==.

**Theorem:** ==If a set contains more vectors than there are entries in each vector, then the set is linearly dependent. That is, any set== ==$\{v_1, ..., v_p\}$==﻿ ==in== ==$\mathbb{R}^n$==﻿ ==is linearly dependent if== ==$p >n$==﻿==.==
