# Information Literacy

==popular== vs. ==scholarly== sources

- ==Scholarly== articles ⇒ are normally peer-reviewed
    - experts in the field do it for free
    - academic journals don’t make a profit

> [!important]  
> The peer review process is double blind  

- ==Popular== articles ⇒ aren’t peer reviewed
    
    - edited by a senior editor
    
    - ==beware! vanity journals==
        - appear to be scholarly
        - usually written by academics with a Ph.D.
        - people pay to get their journals published (around $250 or more per article!)
